    "text": "The goal of this practical is to analyze protein-protein interactions using the classic model system of Barnase-Barstar from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (PDB ID: 1BRS). This system represents an excellent example of protein-protein recognition and binding specificity.\nBarnase is a small extracellular ribonuclease that degrades RNA. On its own, it’s toxic to the producing cell. Barstar is an intracellular protein inhibitor of Barnase that binds extremely tightly and blocks the RNase active site, protecting the bacterium until Barnase is secreted.\nIn this practical, we will prepare the crystal structure, analyze the protein-protein interface, and identify key interacting residues that are critical for complex formation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREMEMBER: Create a working directory\n\n\n\n# Create a new folder for this practical\nmkdir -p ~/BIO512/AF\n# All input and output files will be placed in this directory\n\n# Also note that you need to download the materials from the Vera \nscp -r &lt;your_vera_username&gt;@vera2.chalmers.se:/cephyr/NOBACKUP/groups/n2bin_gu/BIO512/AF/* ~/BIO512/AF/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\nBy the end you should be able to:\n\nPrepare protein complex structures for analysis using YASARA\nVisualize and analyze protein-protein interactions\nIdentify hydrogen bonds at protein interfaces\nDetermine key residues involved in protein-protein recognition\nUnderstand the structural basis of protein binding specificity"

Instead of focusing on the detailed three-dimensional structures of proteins, the study analyzed their composition (the number and types of atoms or functional groups within peptides) and used this as a predictive descriptor of interaction with the human protein survivin (BIRC5)\nThe goal of this practical is to build a classifier that predicts peptide binding signal from microarray data using encoded features derived from amino-acid properties. You will first perform a basic run-through of the provided notebook, then complete a set of ML-focused tasks.\nUse the annotated notebook aa_scan2_clean_annotated.ipynb for the exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a working directory\n\n\n\n# Create a new folder for this practical\nmkdir -p ~/BIO512/ML_lab\n\n# Fetch the required files from Vera\n# do note that &lt;__&gt; is a placeholder for your vera username\nscp -r &lt;your_vera_username&gt;@vera2.chalmers.se:/cephyr/NOBACKUP/groups/n2bin_gu/BIO512/practicals/Peptide_Classification/* ~/BIO512/Peptide_Classification/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\nBy the end you should be able to:\n\nEncode peptide sequences into feature vectors using an AA property table\nCompare classifiers with cross validation using robust metrics\nInterpret influential features in biochemical terms\nReport reproducible results with seeds, versions, and parameters"

    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis tutorial is to take you through the final steps of setting up and accessing the c3se High Performance Computing infrastructure. The specific cluster we will use is called Vera. You will be introduced to this cluster in the lecture and here you can find more information about it, including what resources that are available, how to run jobs and other documentation.\nWe will walk you through step by step in this tutorial so that we (hopefully) can assist if there are any problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-course setup\n\n\n\nTo be able to follow these steps you first have to have followed the steps of the Pre-course Setup including registration at SUPR and application to the course HPC project.\n\n\n\n\n\n2 Setting up a Chalmers ID - IF you have the option to do so in the login portal - else continue to next step\n\nNavigate to https://myaccount.chalmers.se/.\nLog in with your GU account.\nChoose “Activate CID” and follow the instructions to activate your account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember your password!\n\n\n\nThe CID username and password are the ones you will use to log in to the cluster\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Adding Vera/c3se at SUPR\n\nLog in to SUPR\nClick “Accounts” in the left side menu\nRequest access to Vera/c3se\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProceed even without a CID\n\n\n\nIf you don’t have that option in the CID portal you should apply for Vera access in SUPR anyway. They will then assign you a CID that you can access and create a PW for in the CID portal when you have received an email notification about this.\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Setting up Chalmers VPN (if you don’t already have a GU VPN)\nTo be able to access c3se from other networks than in GU or Chalmers, you will need a Chalmers VPN\n\nNavigate to https://chalmers.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/knowledgeitem?unid=07e6154089a648d09711ccc42a42fc88\nFollow the instructions to set up the Chalmers VPN\n\n\n\n\n5 Connecting to the HPC using ssh in VSCode\nTo be able to connect to the HPC in a manner that will let you use the full suite of tools available (or most of them at least) in VSCode, you will need to install the Remote - SSH extension.\n\nOpen VSCode\nGo to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X\nSearch for “Remote - SSH” and install the extension by Microsoft (if youre unsure how install extensions, see here)\nAfter installation, you will see a new icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window. Click on it to open the Remote Explorer view.\n\nIf the SSH Targets are not visible, click on the drop down to expand the view\n\nClick on the + (“New Remote”) icon next to SSH header to add a new SSH host\nIn the input box that appears, enter the SSH connection string for Vera: &lt;your_chalmers_id&gt;@vera1.c3se.chalmers.se (replace &lt;your_chalmers_id&gt; with your actual Chalmers ID)\nPress Enter to confirm\nYou will be prompted to select the SSH configuration file to update. Choose the default option (usually ~/.ssh/config)\n\nOnce you have added the SSH host, you can connect to Vera:\n\nIn the Remote Explorer view, find the Vera entry under SSH Targets (or by clicking on the blue “remote window” icon in the bottom left corner of VSCode)\n\nClick on the “Connect to Host” icon (an arrow if you want the same window, square if you want a new one) next to the Vera entry\nIf you clicked on the blue “remote window” icon, select “Remote-SSH: Connect to Host…” and then select the Vera entry\n\nA new VSCode window will open, and you will be prompted to enter your Chalmers ID password\nAfter entering your password, you should be connected to Vera, and you can start working on the HPC cluster directly from VSCode. Make sure that you open your home folder on Vera to open up a workspace.\nYou can verify that you are connected to Vera by opening a new terminal in VSCode (Terminal &gt; New Terminal) and checking the hostname in the terminal prompt. It should show something like your_chalmers_id@vera:~$"

    "text": "3 Setup for Windows users\nUsing a Windows computer for bioinformatic work has sadly not been ideal most of the time, but large advances in recent years have made this quite feasible through the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\nApart from the Linux kernel provided by WSL, we also recommend installing the integrated development environment (IDE) Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and the tutorial will guide you through how to set up WSL integrated in VS Code. If you already feel comfortable with another IDE such and PyCharm since before, that’s ok but we may not be able to trouble shoot your setup during the course.\nThere are two substantially different versions of the Linux subsystem, WSL1 and WSL2. We strongly recommend using WSL2, which offers an essentially complete Linux experience and better performance.\nUsing the Linux subsystem will give you access to a full command-line bash shell and a Linux implementation on your Windows 10 or 11 PC. For the difference between the Linux Bash Shell and the Windows PowerShell, see e.g. this article.\nThe installation has three main steps:\n\nInstall WSL2 on Windows 10 or 11, follow the instructions here: Installing the Windows Subsystem and the Linux Bash\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you run into error messages when trying to download files through the Linux shell (e.g. curl:(6) Could not resolve host) then try adding the Google name server to the internet configuration by running sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf then add nameserver 8.8.8.8 to the bottom of the file and save it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nWhenever a setup instruction specifies Mac or Linux (i.e. only those two, with no alternative for Windows), please follow the Linux instructions.\n\n\n\nInstall Visual Studio Code on the Windows side (not in WSL).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote: When prompted to Select Additional Tasks during installation, be sure to check the Add to PATH option so you can easily open a folder in WSL using the code command.\n\n\n\nInstall the WSL extension.

Two separate MD simulations have been conducted (~30 ns each): one with the molecular glue (rapamycin) and one without it. MD simulations can reveal how the molecular glue affects the dynamic behavior and stability of the FKBP12/FRB protein complex over time.\nThe key metric we will focus on is the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) of the protein backbone, which indicates conformational changes compared to the initial structure. Lower RMSD values suggest higher structural stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\nBy the end you should be able to:\n\nAnalyze MD simulation trajectories using YASARA\nCalculate and interpret RMSD values over time\nCompare protein stability with and without molecular glue\nGenerate and interpret time-series plots of structural parameters\nDraw conclusions about molecular glue effects on protein complex dynamics"
