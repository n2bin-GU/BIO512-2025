# Introduction

The goal of this practical is to analyze protein-protein interactions using the classic model system of Barnase-Barstar from *Bacillus amyloliquefaciens* (PDB ID: 1BRS). This system represents an excellent example of protein-protein recognition and binding specificity.

**Barnase** is a small extracellular ribonuclease that degrades RNA. On its own, it's toxic to the producing cell. **Barstar** is an intracellular protein inhibitor of Barnase that binds extremely tightly and blocks the RNase active site, protecting the bacterium until Barnase is secreted.

In this practical, we will prepare the crystal structure, analyze the protein-protein interface, and identify key interacting residues that are critical for complex formation.

## REMEMBER: Create a working directory
```bash
# Create a new folder for this practical
mkdir -p ~/BIO512/AF
# All input and output files will be placed in this directory

# Also note that you need to download the materials from the Vera 
scp -r <your_vera_username>@vera2.chalmers.se:/cephyr/NOBACKUP/groups/n2bin_gu/BIO512/AF/* ~/BIO512/AF/
```

## Learning Objectives
By the end you should be able to:

- Prepare protein complex structures for analysis using YASARA
- Visualize and analyze protein-protein interactions
- Identify hydrogen bonds at protein interfaces
- Determine key residues involved in protein-protein recognition

# Structure Preparation and Setup

## Setting up YASARA workspace

1. **Set the working directory** (important):
   - Open YASARA
   - Options > Working directory > navigate and find the 'AF' folder > OK

2. **Download the crystal structure**:
   - File > Load > PDB file from Internet > 1BRS
   - You can see three identical Barnase-Barstar complexes where we need only one

## Understanding the structure contents

3. **Analyze the scene contents**:
   In the right-hand panel, you can see a single object named 1BRS. Click on it to expand. There are 12 molecules under 1BRS:
   
   - **Mol A, B, C** = Barnase (ribonuclease)
   - **Mol D, E, F** = Barstar (inhibitor)
   - **Mol A, B, C, D, E, F (in red)** = water molecules

## Structure cleaning

4. **Remove redundant molecules**:
   - Remove water molecules (highlighted in red) by right-clicking and choosing "Delete"
   - Remove Mol B, C, E, F (right-click and choose "Delete")
   - Now you have only one Barnase (Mol A)-Barstar (Mol D) complex

5. **Center the structure**:
   - Right-click on the object (1brs) from the right-hand panel and choose 'Center'

6. **Add missing hydrogen atoms**:
   - Edit > Clean > All

## Force field and energy minimization

7. **Select the force field**:
   - Simulation > Force field > AMBER 14 > check the box next to 'use PME…' > OK

8. **Minimize the energy**:
   - Options > Energy minimization

9. **Clean up simulation cell**:
   - From the right-hand panel, right-click on SimCell and Delete

10. **Save the prepared complex**:
    - File > Save as > PDB file > select 1BRS from both Sequence and Name panels > OK > give a name (1BRS_complex.pdb)

# Protein-Protein Interface Analysis

## Visualization setup

11. **Optimize visualization**:
    - View > Hide atoms > Aliphatic hydrogens

## Hydrogen bond analysis

12. **Visualize protein-protein interactions**:
    - Open the command window (press space bar on your keyboard)
    - Enter the command: `ShowHBoAtom Mol A with distance<2.6 from Mol D`
    - Alternative command: `ShowHBoAtom Mol D with distance<2.6 from Mol A`
    - You can now see hydrogen bonds between the two proteins shown as yellow dashed lines

::: {.callout-tip}
## Understanding the commands
- `ShowHBoAtom` displays hydrogen bond atoms
- `distance<2.6` sets the maximum distance for hydrogen bond detection (2.6 Å)
- `Mol A` refers to Barnase, `Mol D` refers to Barstar
:::

## Identifying key interactions

13. **Analyze the binding interface**:
    - Take a closer look at the interface between the two proteins
    - Focus on regions with multiple hydrogen bonds
    - Note the types of residues involved in the interactions

14. **Identify critical residues**:
    Examine which residues of Barstar (Mol D) form the most hydrogen bonds with Barnase (Mol A):
    
    - **ASP39 of Barstar**: Forms 4 strong hydrogen bonds with LYS27, ARG83, and ARG87 of Barnase
    - **ASP35 of Barstar**: Forms 2 hydrogen bonds with ARG59 and GLU60 of Barnase
    
::: {.callout-note}
## Experimental validation
Experimental mutagenesis analysis shows that ASP39 and ASP35 are the key residues in the interaction. Mutations of these residues significantly disrupt complex formation.
:::

## Sequence preparation for further analysis

15. **Obtain sequences for downstream analysis**:
    - Open your internet browser and go to www.rcsb.org
    - Search for 1BRS
    - Click on 'Download Files' and choose 'FASTA Sequence'
    - Open the downloaded FASTA file using a text editor (notepad on Windows)
    - You can see the sequences of both proteins that will be used in the next practical

# Analysis Questions

Use your structural analysis to answer the following questions:

## Structural Analysis

1. **How many hydrogen bonds** do you observe at the Barnase-Barstar interface? Which regions show the highest density of interactions?

2. **What types of amino acids** are predominantly involved in the protein-protein interface? Are they mostly charged, polar, or hydrophobic?

3. **Why do you think ASP39 and ASP35** are particularly important for binding? Consider their chemical properties and interaction partners.

## Interface Characterization

4. **Describe the shape complementarity** between Barnase and Barstar. Is the interface flat or does it involve deep binding pockets?

5. **What would you predict** would happen if ASP39 was mutated to:
   - Alanine (A) - a small, nonpolar residue?
   - Arginine (R) - a positively charged residue?

6. **From a biological perspective**, why is tight binding between Barnase and Barstar essential for the bacterium?

## Experimental Design

7. **If you were to design experiments** to test the importance of the identified residues, what mutations would you make and what assays would you perform?

8. **Besides hydrogen bonds**, what other types of interactions might be important at this interface? How could you analyze them?

# Key Structural Insights

Based on your analysis, the Barnase-Barstar complex demonstrates several important principles:

## Binding Specificity
- **Electrostatic complementarity**: Negatively charged Asp residues in Barstar interact with positively charged Lys/Arg residues in Barnase
- **Shape complementarity**: The proteins fit together like puzzle pieces
- **Multiple contact points**: Several residues contribute to the overall binding affinity

## Functional Implications
- **Active site blocking**: Barstar binding prevents RNA access to Barnase active site
- **Regulatory mechanism**: Tight binding allows controlled release of Barnase activity
- **Evolutionary optimization**: The interface has evolved for maximum binding strength

## Preparation for Next Practical

In the next practical, you will use AI-based structure prediction (AlphaFold3) to:
- Predict the structure of the wild-type Barnase-Barstar complex
- Model the effects of mutations on complex formation
- Compare predicted structures with the crystal structure you analyzed today

The sequences you obtained in step 15 will be used as input for AlphaFold3 predictions.
