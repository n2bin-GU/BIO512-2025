# Introduction

In this practical, we will apply AI-based protein complex structure prediction using AlphaFold3 (AF3). You will learn about the capabilities of AF3 in predicting protein complexes from wild-type sequences and the effects of mutations on complex formation.

Building on the previous practical where you analyzed the crystal structure of the Barnase-Barstar complex and identified key interacting residues (ASP39 and ASP35), you will now use AF3 to predict how mutations to these critical residues affect complex stability and formation.

# Mutational Analysis

Based on the previous structural analysis, we identified that ASP39 and ASP35 of Barstar are critical for binding. We'll test two different mutation scenarios:

## Mutation to Alanine (conservative)

5. **Prepare D39A-D35A mutant sequences**:
   - Take the Barstar sequence from the FASTA file
   - Find position 39 (ASP/D) and replace with Alanine (A)
   - Find position 35 (ASP/D) and replace with Alanine (A)
   - Keep Barnase sequence unchanged

6. **Submit D39A-D35A prediction**:
   - Enter the mutated Barstar sequence
   - Enter the WT Barnase sequence
   - Job name: `wtBarnase_D39A-D35ABarstar`
   - Submit and download results when complete

## Mutation to Arginine (charge reversal)

7. **Prepare D39R-D35R mutant sequences**:
   - Take the Barstar sequence from the FASTA file
   - Find position 39 (ASP/D) and replace with Arginine (R)
   - Find position 35 (ASP/D) and replace with Arginine (R)
   - Keep Barnase sequence unchanged

8. **Submit D39R-D35R prediction**:
   - Enter the mutated Barstar sequence
   - Enter the WT Barnase sequence
   - Job name: `wtBarnase_D39R-D35RBarstar`
   - Submit and download results when complete

# Results Analysis

## Confidence metrics comparison

9. **Compare AF3 confidence scores**:

| Complex | ipTM | pTM |
|---------|------|-----|
| WT | 0.93 | 0.94 |
| D39A-D35A | 0.89 | 0.92 |
| D39R-D35R | 0.25 | 0.62 |

::: {.callout-note}
## Interpreting metrics
- **pTM**: Confidence in overall fold (0-1 scale, >0.8 is high confidence)
- **ipTM**: Confidence in interface prediction (0-1 scale, >0.8 is high confidence)
- Lower scores indicate less confidence in the predicted structure
:::

## Structural comparison with crystal structure

10. **Prepare YASARA for comparison**:
    - Clean up YASARA screen: File > New > Yes
    - Open the prepared crystal structure: `1BRS_complex.pdb`
    - Open the AF3 predicted WT structure: `model_0.cif` (from wtBarnase_wtBarstar folder)

::: {.callout-tip}
## AF3 output format
AF3 predicts 5 models (model_0 to model_4) where model_0 always has the highest-ranking confidence value.
:::

11. **Superpose predicted on crystal structure**:
    - Analyze > Superpose > Objects
    - Select "fold_wtbaranase…" (predicted structure) from Sequence panel > OK
    - Select "1BRS_complex…" (crystal structure) from Sequence panel > OK
    - In "Set parameters" window: Uncheck all boxes except "Residue name" and "Residue number" > OK

12. **Calculate RMSD for Barstar**:
    - Analyze > RMSD of > Molecules
    - Choose "D" (Barstar of crystal structure) from Sequence panel > OK
    - Choose "A" (predicted Barstar) > OK > OK
    - RMSD value will be shown in the command window

13. **Repeat for mutant structures**:
    - Clean up YASARA screen and repeat steps 10-12 for both mutant predictions
    - Complete the RMSD comparison table:

| Comparison Pair | RMSD (Å) |
|-----------------|----------|
| Crystal vs WT | 2.76 |
| Crystal vs D39A-D35A | 2.90 |
| Crystal vs D39R-D35R | 9.42 |

# Interpretation and Discussion

## Understanding the results

14. **Analysis of AF3 performance**:

The results reveal important insights about AF3's capabilities and limitations:

### Alanine mutations (D39A-D35A):
- **Small decrease** in confidence metrics (ipTM: 0.93→0.89)
- **Minimal structural change** (RMSD: 2.76→2.90 Å)
- **AF3 prediction**: Minor effect on complex formation
- **Experimental reality**: These mutations drastically reduce binding affinity

### Arginine mutations (D39R-D35R):
- **Dramatic decrease** in confidence metrics (ipTM: 0.93→0.25)
- **Large structural deviation** (RMSD: 2.76→9.42 Å)
- **AF3 prediction**: Major disruption of complex formation
- **Experimental expectation**: Strong electrostatic repulsion would indeed disrupt binding

## Critical analysis questions

Answer the following questions based on your results:

### AF3 Performance Assessment

1. **How well does AF3 predict the wild-type complex?** Compare the confidence metrics and RMSD with the crystal structure.

2. **What do the confidence metrics tell us** about AF3's certainty in its predictions for each variant?

3. **Why might AF3 fail to capture the effect** of alanine mutations but successfully predict the impact of arginine mutations?

### Structural Biology Insights

4. **From a chemical perspective**, explain why:
   - D39A and D35A mutations might be more disruptive experimentally than AF3 predicts
   - D39R and D35R mutations show large effects in both experiments and AF3 predictions

5. **What does this tell us about** the different types of interactions that stabilize protein complexes?

### Methodological Considerations

6. **What are the limitations** of using AF3 for mutational studies? When might it be reliable vs unreliable?

7. **How could you validate** these computational predictions experimentally?

8. **What other computational approaches** could complement AF3 for studying mutation effects?

# Advanced Analysis (Optional)

For students interested in deeper analysis:

## Detailed structural comparison
- Analyze specific interface regions in detail
- Compare hydrogen bonding patterns between structures
- Examine conformational changes upon mutation

## Additional mutations
- Predict effects of single mutations (D39A only, D35A only)
- Test conservative mutations (D39E, D35E)
- Explore mutations in Barnase instead of Barstar

## Key Takeaways

- **AF3 excels** at predicting wild-type protein complex structures with high confidence
- **Mutation effects** are not always accurately captured, especially for subtle changes
- **Charge-reversal mutations** (D→R) are better predicted than loss-of-function mutations (D→A)
- **Confidence metrics** (pTM, ipTM) provide valuable information about prediction reliability
- **Experimental validation** remains essential for understanding mutation effects
- **AI predictions** should be interpreted alongside structural and chemical principles

## Biological Significance

This analysis demonstrates that:

1. **Protein-protein interfaces** rely on multiple, subtle interactions that may not be fully captured by current AI models

2. **Electrostatic interactions** are crucial for the Barnase-Barstar interface and are better predicted than hydrophobic or entropic effects

3. **AF3 represents a powerful tool** for structural biology but has limitations that must be understood

4. **Computational and experimental approaches** are complementary for understanding protein function

The Barnase-Barstar system serves as an excellent model for understanding both the capabilities and limitations of AI-based structure prediction in the context of protein evolution and design.
