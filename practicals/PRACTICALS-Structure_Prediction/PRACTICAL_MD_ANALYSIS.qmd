# Introduction

In this practical, we will analyze the results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to understand the impact of molecular glue on protein complex stability. Two separate MD simulations have been conducted (~30 ns each): one with the molecular glue (rapamycin) and one without it. MD simulations can reveal how the molecular glue affects the dynamic behavior and stability of the protein complex over time.

# MD Analysis with Molecular Glue

## Running the analysis

::: {.callout-note}
These simulations take a long time to run, so we have pre-computed the trajectories for you. Your task is to analyze these trajectories to extract meaningful insights about the effect of the molecular glue.
:::

**Set the working directory**:

   - Open YASARA
   - Set the working directory to your copied MD folder (if you want to be extra specific `./MD/with_glue`)

**Set the target**:

   - Options > Macro & Movies > Set target > 3FAP_complex.sce

::: {.callout-tip}
You might need to swap back to file extension instead of "from underscore" when setting the target.
:::

**Execute MD analysis**:

   - Options > Macro & Movies > play macro > md_analyze.mcr > OK
   
::: {.callout-note}
## Analysis time
This analysis takes some time to complete. The macro will process the entire trajectory and calculate various structural parameters.
:::

## Interpreting the results
After Analysis is done, the results will be shown in an “html” file where you can see all different analysis metric with explanations for each. For this tutorial, the most important metric is “Solute RMSD from the starting structure” focused on proteins backbone (RMSDBb) which indicates the protein’s conformational deviation compared to the initial structure by time. The raw data of the plots are available in the file named “3FAP_complex_analysis.tab”

**Review the HTML report**:

   - After analysis is complete, results will be shown in an HTML file
   - The report contains different analysis metrics with explanations
   - Focus on **"Solute RMSD from the starting structure"** for protein backbone (RMSDBb)

# Data Processing and Visualization

## Extracting data

**Download the analysis file**:

   - Download `3FAP_complex_analysis.tab` to your local computer (ex. zip it and *scp* or similar)

**Open in spreadsheet software**:

   - Open the file using MS Excel or similar software
   - Locate the RMSDBb column and time column

**Calculate average RMSD**:

   - Calculate the average RMSD over the second half of the simulation (t > 15ns)
   - This represents the equilibrated state of the system
   - Record this value for comparison

# MD Analysis without Molecular Glue

## Repeat analysis for control system

**Set new working directory**:

   - Change working directory to `MD/without_glue`

**Repeat steps 2-9**:

   - Set target to the complex without glue
   - Run md_analyze.mcr
   - Download and process the analysis results
   - Plot RMSD vs time
   - Calculate average RMSD for t > 15ns

# Comparative Analysis

## Generating comparison plots

**Create comparative visualization**:

   - Plot both RMSD curves on a single graph:
     - Line 1: With molecular glue (rapamycin)
     - Line 2: Without molecular glue
   - Use different colors/styles to distinguish the two conditions
   - Include proper labels and legend

::: {.callout-important}
## Q4 What are the average RMSD values for the second half of each simulation (t > 15ns)?

- With molecular glue: _____ Å
- Without molecular glue: _____ Å
:::

:::{.callout-important}
## Q5 What differences do you observe in the RMSD profiles between the two simulations? (1-2 sentences).

# How to Submit Your Work

- Continue on the notebook from the previous practical 
- Include screenshots of relevant structures and analyses (you can use the snipping tool or any screenshot tool, then drag and drop the image into the jupyter notebook cell)
